`mvn package`

`java -jar analyzer.jar [path to the project]`

## Heuristics
- `BooleanMethodNamingChecker` - check whether boolean method names conform the rule 'should ask a question in the method names'.
- `ClassLineChecker` - check whether classes have less then 250 lines.
- `VariableNameLengthChecker` - check whether variables have not too long and not loo small names.
- `NamingConventionChecker` - check whether variables conform the 'camelCase' naming rule and classes conform the 'CamelCase' naming rule.
- `IncompatibleDeclarationsCheck` - check whether all declarations of methods are correct.
(For example: private and static methods should not be final /
non-public method should not have public constructor /
method cannot be 'abstract' and also 'private', 'static').
